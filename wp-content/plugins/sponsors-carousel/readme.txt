This plugin displays thumbnail images or banners in a carousel using jQuery jCarousel.


== Description ==

NEW! Introduced Wordpress 5.0 Gutenberg Editor block!

Sponsors Carousel implements the jCarousel as a WordPress plugin.

You can set internal link for all image or custom link for any image.

Upload images use Wordpress Media.

Drag'n'drop for change image order

Multiple carousels on one page.

The plugin uses the shortcode [sponsors_carousel], [sponsors_carousel id=1] ...

The plugin uses jQuery, and if your site doesn't already use jQuery, it'll add the script for you.

It was inspired by jCarousel by Jan Sorgalla.
